This is the frontend of my auth application, [Authogonal](https://authogonal.netlify.app/). Authogonal's code is organized in accordance with the MVC architecture. This entire repository is a React application serving as an implementation of the View layer, i.e., the user interface by means of which the Amazon DynamoDB database's contents may be accessed and modified. As for the Model and Controller layers, their implementations are on the backend, which you can find in my repo [`auth-backend`](https://github.com/brbavar/auth-backend).
